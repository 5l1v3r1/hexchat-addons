This script should make Windows 10 notifications look better than they do by default.
In this script, highlighted messages take the format:

Highlighted message from: sacarasc (#hexchat)
<+sacarasc> I think you're cool, scriptuser!

And channel actions are like this:

Highlighted action from: sacarasc (#hexchat)
* sacarasc hugs scriptuser.

To use this, I believe you need Windows 10, as it won't work on previous.
You will need HexChat 2.11.0+ too.

Also, please turn off notifications in Settings -> Preferences -> Alerts for highlighted messages only. You can keep on the ones for private.
