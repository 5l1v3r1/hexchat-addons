1. Install build tools. i.e. yum groupinstall development-tools or apt-get install build-essential
2. Install glib-devel and lua-devel (-dev in debians)
3. make && make install
4. Restart hexchat
5. Read online docs - http://ankh-morp.org/code/xchat-lua/

If you get tons of errors during compilation try replacing "lua5.1" with "lua" in the makefile.
