OperBuddy is designed with IRCops in mind.
This plugin will separate important messages from the server into their own tabs, as well as automatically requesting whois information for new queries, and sending users an automatic response while you are away.

Settings:
You can use '/operbuddy set <setting> <value>' to change the following settings.
use_away_message	This setting determines whether or not we will send people an automated response when you are away. (0 = off, 1 = on)
whois_on_query		Do you want to get whois information when users open a new query with you? (0 = off, 1 = on)
show_full_server_name	In server message tabs would you like to see the full server name or just the hostname? (0 = hostname, 1 = Full server name)
away_message		The message to send when someone opens a new query with you while you are away.
