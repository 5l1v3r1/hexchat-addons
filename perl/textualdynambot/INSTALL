textualdynambot
Installation

This script requires the Perl plugin for xchat v2.6.0+ to be installed 
and loaded.

Find your config directory.

	*nix (fink, too?): ~/.xchat2/
	winxp: C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\X-Chat 2\
	vista/w7: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\X-Chat 2\
	xchat-aqua: use the Plugins dir inside your xchat program dir

Put all .pl (the script) and .conf (configuration) files in your 
config directory.

If upgrading from thermodynambot rename:
  _thermodynambot.conf
    to
  textualdynambot.conf

The script (.pl) requires NO modification to use it. Simply
edit the configuration file (.conf).

Unload/reload the Perl plugin (/reloadall or use the 'Windows->
Plugins and Scripts...' utility).

The script will print:
textualdynambot vXYZ by LifeIsPain, based on thermodynambot by b0at (use...)

Barring error messages, it is loaded and ready.
