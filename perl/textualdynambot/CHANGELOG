Features/Compatibility Change Log

Each release (especially emergency releases with a 
	hypenated version) offers bug fixes, cleaner code,
	and improved functionality over the previous one.

Please use the latest version.

009.01 - 2010/06/05
- Load configuration file as UTF-8
- Silently ignore lines where the text isn't defined

009 - 2010/05/26
- Move rule throttling until after other conditions are met
- Allow all macros to be prefixed with '\' to escape the value
- Changed default character for what is considered a regex for
   'from' address from '&' to '/', update your conf if you use
   regular expressions for froms
- Fixed problem where regex on 'from' wasn't actually working
- Networks and Channels now may be prefixed with '/' to designate
   the rest of the string as a regular expression
- Redo 'action' and 'private' +in/-in options to be directly
   associated with the channel and network. Some rules may need
   to be modified. If you have '+in: *, action', this means all
   messages and all actions said within channels.
- Add 'highlight', 'nohighlight', and 'message' modifiers to
   +in/-in rules, consistent with redone 'action' and 'private'.
   'highlight' and 'nohighlight' are mutually exclusive, although
   if neither is specified, defaults to both.
- Support is in place for '*:action:private', however this will
   only work in XChat when one of LifeIsPain's patches is applied
   (submitted to XChat, hopefully will be in 2.8.8). Until then,
   to catch actions in PM, use: +in: *:/[^#&!].+:action
- Can stop listening for events with "/tdb off" "/tdb unload",
   "/textualdynambot off" or "/textualdynambot unload". Use
   "/tdb" or "/textualdynambot" to listen again.

008 - 2010/05/19
- Remove requirement for a space in +in: Network:#channel
- Can now use \? if you want a question mark within [line:]
   and [text:], and \* if you want to match an asterisk. Use
   additional \s if you wish to escape the \
- Fixed issue of context not always being correct after /who

007 - 2010/05/15
- Made as complete fork of thermodynambot
- Suport for older versions of xchat removed
- Added in per rule throttling based on time, times used, and
   optional same session usage
- Fixed issue of "uninitialized value $hook" when receiving
   private messages
- Modified method of obtaining hosts based on other open tabs
- Slightly more efficient when loading the configuration file

As thermodynambot
006 - 2010/04/27 - LifeIsPain edits pre declared fork
- Network:#channel combinations now correctly work in +in and -in
   rather than just matching channel portion
- +in: * and +from: * are only defaults if +in: or +from: is not
   defined by another line, so isn't always enabled
- If "private" or "network:private" is in the +in, now does not
   get matched by channel messages
- Better handling of /who, won't send a request if it is still
   waiting for a previous request, uses fewer hooks, and doesn't
   send a request if a reply will probably come in due to a join
- Along with above, no longer get an error message when a
   variable isn't available to split

005.02
- +from: * and +in: * are now the implicit defaults, so you can 
   leave them out entirely in the config entries

005.01
- Changed how the "who" entry is composed for a user so possible 
   undefined string warnings will be avoided when dealing with 
   strange host masks.

005
- now searches through tabs to find a user on the same network
	when user_info turns up nothing; 
	then hooks /who as a last resort

004 (through 004-01)
- added %o macro
- hooked /who when user_info turned up dry

003 (through 003-03)
- added %w macro
- added optional wildcard networks for in (where)

002
- added user-command testing (TBDECHO and TDBTEST commands)
- made +in/-in interchangeable with +where/-where to make
	it more clear when glancing at the rules
- now using 'none' to signify no mode

001 (first release)
- used '-' to signify no mode 
	(the only incompatibility issue for later versions)
